                        We have been sent to retrieve the remains. In any case, they shouldn't be replace in the crypt.

                        Not long ago, I went to Nervie... I heard about the terrible event. But I also heard about a team of heroes trying to save the village.

                        Chrisemon is not a craven. Please, let me help you in your quest.
